# Avocado JuiceBar Business Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the business operations and sales data of Avocado JuiceBar, a juice and shawarma business located in Thiruvalla, Kerala. The analysis focuses on understanding the correlation between juice and shawarma sales, and the impact of temporary shawarma production shutdown on overall business profitability.

## Business Context
Avocado JuiceBar is owned and operated by Mr. Richas, offering:
- Fresh juices and shakes
- Shawarma
- Located in Thiruvalla, Kerala

## Data Collection
The analysis is based on:
- Daily sales data (November through February)
- Cost data (2-week sample)
- Product details (24 main products)
- Customer behavior patterns

## Key Findings
1. **Product Correlation**
   - Moderate correlation (0.58) between food and drinks sales
   - Only 38% of juice sales occur alongside shawarma purchases

2. **Profitability Analysis**
   - Shawarma: ~₹500 daily profit
   - Juice sales: ~₹3500 daily profit

3. **Impact Assessment**
   - Temporary shawarma shutdown has minimal impact on overall profitability
   - Juice sales show short-term dip (up to 38%) but recover quickly
   - Employee layoff costs offset shawarma production losses

## Recommendations
1. Consider reducing shawarma production costs
2. Explore alternative high-margin products
3. Focus on juice section expansion, especially during summer
